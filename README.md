## Local configuration

Some of the used tools requires local configuration. Such as `git` with username and email.

Here's the full list:

1. `~/.gitconfig_local` to store any user-specific data
2. `~/.shell_env_local` to store local shell config, like: usernames, passwords, tokens, `gpg` keys and so on
